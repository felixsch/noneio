My name is Felix Schnizlein, on the internet mostly "felixsch". I'm a hobby developer with an obsession for all kind of programming languages. Currently learning Haskell, because this programming language solves a lot problems which sadly still exists in most other languages. Also thinking in a functional way had a great impact on my way to deal with programming problems.

In my free time I play bass guitar and love cooking vegan food.

This blog features everything what comes to my mind. From article on development topics or just about the vegan bakery I made yesterday.

none.io is written in Haskell using the awesome static generator package [Hakyll](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hakyll). If you are interested in the source checkout the [github repository](https://github.com/felixsch/noneio).
