<span style="font-size: 6em;">About</span>

Hi, my name is Felix Schnizlein (online mostly __felixsch__). I'm a hobby programmer and Linux enthusiast.

[http://none.io](http://none.io) is about all the things that comes to my mind. Currently my blog is about Linux and programming. But this might change!

Currently I live at Ratisbona and study _technische Informatik_ (CS) at local college (Ost Bayerische Hochschule).

Besides studying, I work as a student employee as a PHP developer.
